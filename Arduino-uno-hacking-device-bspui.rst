Here we will be using an Arduino Uno/Nano/Mega to fuzz the debug pins on a router, and then use the Arduino as an USB to Serial converter to talk to the device and hopefully obtain a shell. Please note that this project has been created to talk over Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART), other projects such as JTAGenum have been created to Estimated Reading Time: 5 mins.  · · Hacking with Arduino: Build Your Own USB Payload.

Projects Discussion and Showcase Device Hacking. mynkpl January 9, , pm #1. I am trying to make Arduino uno to act as a keyboard, i have successfully flashed the USB-HID firmware in it using this link also and programmed it like this. uint8_t buf [8] = { 0 }; int inpin1 = 7; int inpin2 = 8; int val1 = 0; int val2 = 0; void setup () { .
