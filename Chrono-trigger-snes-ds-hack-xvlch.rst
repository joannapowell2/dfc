2. level 1. adventuregamerseb. Op · 4y. Started playing it. Seems very polished so far Some lines from snes and others from ds. Keeps frog's formal dialogue (fortunately) and some funny lines (I'm so happy I couls scream), but uses the more extended script from ds version at other times. Seems like a great version so far.
