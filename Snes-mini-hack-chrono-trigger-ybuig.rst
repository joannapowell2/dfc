Chrono Trigger Coliseum is a super nintendo ROM hack based on the super mario world SNES game. The Chrono Trigger Coliseum is simply an arena where players can battle on three levels of difficulty, either with the party or a solo party member, for prizes redeemable by battle points.  · So no DK2. Chrono Trigger is a bit harder to pin down. Nintendo already managed to snag licenses for two other Square titles for the SNES Classic - Secret of Mana and Final Fantasy III - so it seems unlikely that Square put the screws to Nintendo on Chrono Trigger, especially considering they’ve re-released the game on previous Nintendo. Description: This Chrono Trigger updates the script of this wonderful game to modern standards, while keeping the nuanced but lovable translation and characteristics of the original script. The hack combines the loved, quirky translation of the original SNES version, with the more extended script of the DS version, to create the best Chrono Trigger ry: Improvement.
