 · So by now, some of you may be wondering what Flames of Eternity means. With Chrono Cross long gone, a few years ago a team undertook the ambitious project of creating a true Chrono Trigger sequel. This game was an interquel between Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross. This hack was entitled Crimson Echoes.  · The true Chrono Trigger sequel we've been waiting for since is finally here in the form of Chrono Trigger Flames of Eternity, a rom hack of the original. Flames of Eternity. The ultimate Chrono Trigger hack! It's a whole new game! The story takes place after the events of the original game. It aims to follow the old adventurers on a new journey. A great deal of work has been put into this. This is an improvement based on an older hack called Crimson Echoes. Here's the homepage for this project.
