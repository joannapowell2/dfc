 · Chrono Trigger Rom Hack Download Many think the third installment in the Mega Man X series is the last truly great game in the franchise. But there’s one area where Mega Man X4 and subsequent titles surpass it: Zero as a playable character. Chrono Trigger is a SNES RPG similar to the Final Fantasy series. The story takes place in many different time periods ranging from the pre-historic days to the end of time. It has a “New Game +” mode and 13 different endings (determined by when you choose to battle the final boss) so the replay value on this one is through the : Role Playing. Chrono Trigger Coliseum This incredible hack installs a battle arena in A.D. Three ladders of monsters exist for three difficulties - easy, medium, or hard. The ladders can be ascended with either a full party or a single member from Crono's group fighting the battles; for each win, "battle points" are earned.
