CT Devolution is a comical retelling of the Chrono Trigger story. All the dialog has been gutted and re-worked, transforming the game into a hilarious parody of epic proportions! It is a totally irreverent tribute to the original game that completely changes the personalities of Category: Complete. Chrono Trigger is a SNES RPG similar to the Final Fantasy series. The story takes place in many different time periods ranging from the pre-historic days to the end of time. It has a ‚ÄúNew Game +‚Äù mode and 13 different endings (determined by when you choose to battle the final boss) so the replay value on this one is through the roof. Content:Genre: Role Playing. Chrono Triggered is a spoof/comedic romhack that was created using google translate. The results are highly triggering, and comical at times. If you‚Äôve ever wanted a reason to replay the great classic with a completely butchered messed up plot, iconic characters reduced to mental patients, and a somehow even more bad-ass incoherent Magus Category: Complete.
