25 rows · Chrono Trigger - Easy Hack V by OTAKU Force. () Classic (Console-Style) RPG. US title. Description: This Chrono Trigger updates the script of this wonderful game to modern standards, while keeping the nuanced but lovable translation and characteristics of the original script. The hack combines the loved, quirky translation of the original SNES version, with the more extended script of the DS version, to create the best Chrono Trigger ry: Improvement. Chrono Trigger is rather easy for most of the game. The author figured that someone ought to rectify this! This is a hack that simply makes Chrono Trigger more challenging (albeit not to an extreme degree), and thereby more fun (according to the author!) Because Chrono Trigger was already pretty well balanced, this was an easy hack to implement compared to the other Category: Improvement.
