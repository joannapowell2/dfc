But there’s one area where Mega Man X4 and subsequent titles surpass it: Zero as a playable character. Chrono Trigger is a SNES RPG similar to the Final Fantasy series.

It has a “New Game +” mode and 13 different endings (determined by when you choose to battle the final boss) so the replay value on this one is through the : Role Playing. This Chrono Trigger updates the script of this wonderful game to modern standards, while keeping the nuanced but lovable translation and characteristics of the original script.
